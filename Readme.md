# CS 235 - Assignment Files and Instructions

The instructions and required files for each CS 235 assignment are found in this repo.

## Homework Files

In each homework folder are the instructions for that assignment and the files you will need.

You should use the `.cpp` and `.h` files that are provided. Do not change the names of any files.

### Testing your code

You are responsible for testing your own code; however, we provide a few files that may be useful to you. These are found in the `test_files` folder of the starter code for each assignment.

Files ending in `.dialog.txt` demonstrate an expected terminal-like interaction with your programâ€”i.e. if you were to run your program in the terminal and provide the inputs shown, you should see the outputs shown.

Files ending in `.input.txt` are files you may use as input to your program (assuming your program expects an input file). 

Files ending in `.output.txt` demonstrate the expected output of your program when provided with the associated `.input.txt` input file.

Files ending in `.stdout.txt` demonstrate the expected STDOUT of your program when provided with the associated `.input.txt` input file.

Some homework assignments will also have a `tests.cpp` file. This file is compiled with the files from your assignment (i.e. your `.h` files).
Look through this file to understand what kinds of operations will be performed on your data structures. 

## Submitting Your Homework

Your assignments are submitted through Canvas (which in turn uses Gradescope). 

You should turn in only the `.cpp` and `.h` files that you modify or create. Extra files provided with the assignment will be available within the autograder (and the autograder will overwrite any changes you make with the original versions).
