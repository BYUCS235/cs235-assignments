## Binary Search Tree Find

Write a function to perform a search in a binary search tree in `find.h`.

- The struct `Node` for the binary search tree nodes is provided
- Implement the function `bool find(Node* root, int item)` for searching a value in the tree
  - The function takes a pointer to the root of the subtree, and an integer `item` to search for
  - The function returns `true` if the item is found, or `false` otherwise
- Assume the tree is a valid binary search tree

## Grading

`find.h` is worth 100 points.
