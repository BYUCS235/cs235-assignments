# HW 3c

## Sort

Write a program to sort lines of text in `sort.cpp`.

- `sort.cpp` should read lines from standard input (cin) or from a file (if a filename is provided as a command-line argument).
- The program should use the **insertion sort** algorithm.
- After sorting, the program should print the sorted lines to standard output (cout).
- Sort according to standard string comparisons.
- Follow the formatting demonstrated in the example.

### Example

**`input.txt`**
```
banana
apple
grape
```

**Usage**

**Input file**
```
$ ./sort input.txt
apple
banana
grape
```

**Stdin**
Input from stdin is italicized
<pre>
$ ./sort
<em>banana</em>
<em>apple</em>
<em>grape</em>
apple
banana
grape

</pre>

## Grading

`sort.cpp` is worth 100 points.

|----------------|----------|
| already sorted | 25       |
| reversed       | 25       |
| shuffled       | 25       |
| stdin          | 25       |
